## ðŸš€ About Completing this Project

It took about 7 hours to complete. But I didn't work continuously. I tried to split all the code into separate components. In all cases I used tailwind css.

Some of my prjects and repositories: 

1. [Sleep Time Music](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codebookit.sleeptimemusic) --- For Zecodeek It and Codebook-it
2. [MERN Tutorials Blog](https://mern-tutorials-blog-client.vercel.app/)  ---  University Thrid Year Noob Project, but I love this.
